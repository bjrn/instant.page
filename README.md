# near-instant.page

> **Note** This is a slightly modified version of the [original instant.page script](https://www.npmjs.com/package/instant.page). The main differences are that configuration via `<body>` attributes has been removed and `mousedown=true` by default. 
>
> Disable preloading on individual links with `<a href="..." data-no-instant>â€¦</a>`.
